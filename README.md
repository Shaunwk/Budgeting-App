### Progress 2 
5/17/2023

Updated the JS to have a toggle instead of a if/else statment for the links toggle. 

I also updated the CSS to have the new classes created and implemented a keyframe with opacity changes. I applied that animation to the links-list.

In the HTML I deleted the inline style of display:none and put it in the CSS instead. 


### Progress 1
5/16/2023

Created a reset.css file to have all the resets like "box-sizing: border-box" and much more. 

Basic designing has been implemented with reusable code. 
The reusable code is "d-flex" for easily applying flexbox to a container.
Another reusable piece of code is "box" which has box-shadow, border radius, padding and some more to have all boxes the same.
There are a few other resusable code like "progress-bar-oultine" and "box-title".

I made the HTML file organized so it is easier to revisit and find your way around. 

The first stages of JavaScript have been implemented.
Stage 1 was the toggle for a dropdown menu that have links inside. 
The JS uses an "addEventListener" and a "if/else statment" to control the opening and closong of the menu and contains style changes. 

Stage 2. Create functional use by user allowing user to input income and display it on the screen. It has a running total and 
stores the inputs into "localStorage" so it is still there even on a page reresh. 
This part is not done and is needing to be tweaked.
I can't get the income submit button to work on mobile. On desktop it works fine. 

I will be working on this JavaScript and will have a new update when it works properly.
